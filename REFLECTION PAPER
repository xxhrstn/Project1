Concluding all of the information that I have read and gathered in the website.I can say that Github is a website where codes are typed and arranged for someone to create a project.It allows any valid user to make his or her project for any purposes.There are several kinds of codes that can be typed for you to start your and end your dream project.For you to start,of course you need to know what are those codes that will be essential to your project.You need to know what are their purposes,you also need to know how and where to put a certain code.If you already have a plan on your project,you need to start to make the skeleton of it.It should have the head,the body and etc.You should put your email and your name so that Git will mark your commits accordingly.You should be careful on the codes that you will put in your project because a letter,a number or a symbol will affect the project of yours if typed incorrecctly or misplaced.You need to have the right commands for it to work.If you are already done,you can already save and label it.
I do not know how this website truly works for I am not a code whiz.But I am eager to learn step by step about how Github works.For what I have read and understood,yes it needs to have a lot of work,time,effort and patience for you to accomplish your dream project,but I think it's gonna be all worthh it on the end.
